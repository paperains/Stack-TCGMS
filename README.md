# Stack TCGMS
Stack TCGMS is an online TCG management system that pretty much hosts everything you'll need for your basic TCG.
This has been a fun project of mine ever since MyTCG became deprecated and left unupdated.
For more information about the added suggested features that are being developed for Stack, you can find it on the [masterlist](https://github.com/paperains/Stack-TCGMS/blob/main/MASTERLIST.md) file.
